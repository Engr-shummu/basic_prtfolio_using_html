      Bali (/ˈbɑːli/; Balinese: ᬩᬮᬶ) is a province of Indonesia and the
      westernmost of the Lesser Sunda Islands. East of Java and west of Lombok,
      the province includes the island of Bali and a few smaller offshore
      islands, notably Nusa Penida, Nusa Lembongan, and Nusa Ceningan to the
      southeast. The provincial capital, Denpasar,[7] is the most populous city
      in the Lesser Sunda Islands and the second-largest, after Makassar, in
      Eastern Indonesia. The upland town of Ubud in Greater Denpasar is
      considered Bali's cultural centre. The province is Indonesia's main
      tourist destination, with a significant rise in tourism since the
      1980s.[8] Tourism-related business makes up 80% of its economy.[9] Bali is
      the only Hindu-majority province in Indonesia, with 86.9% of the
      population adhering to Balinese Hinduism.[3] It is renowned for its highly
      developed arts, including traditional and modern dance, sculpture,
      painting, leather, metalworking, and music. The Indonesian International
      Film Festival is held every year in Bali. Other international events that
      have been held in Bali include Miss World 2013, the 2018 Annual Meetings
      of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group and the 2022
      G20 summit. In March 2017, TripAdvisor named Bali as the world's top
      destination in its Traveller's Choice award, which it also earned in
      January 2021.[10][11] Bali is part of the Coral Triangle, the area with
      the highest biodiversity of marine species, especially fish and
      turtles.[12] In this area alone, over 500 reef-building coral species can
      be found. For comparison, this is about seven times as many as in the
      entire Caribbean.[13] Bali is the home of the Subak irrigation system, a
      UNESCO World Heritage Site.[14] It is also home to a unified confederation
      of kingdoms composed of 10 traditional royal Balinese houses, each house
      ruling a specific geographic area. The confederation is the successor of
      the Bali Kingdom. The royal houses are not recognised by the government of
      Indonesia; however, they originated before Dutch colonisation.[15]
      Singapore, city-state located at the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula,
      about 85 miles (137 kilometres) north of the Equator. It consists of the
      diamond-shaped Singapore Island and some 60 small islets; the main island
      occupies all but about 18 square miles of this combined area. The main
      island is separated from Peninsular Malaysia to the north by Johor Strait,
      a narrow channel crossed by a road and rail causeway that is more than
      half a mile long. The southern limits of the state run through Singapore
      Strait, where outliers of the Riau-Lingga Archipelago—which forms a part
      of Indonesia—extend to within 10 miles of the main island. Singapore

      Malaysia, country of Southeast Asia, lying just north of the Equator, that
      is composed of two noncontiguous regions: Peninsular Malaysia (Semenanjung
      Malaysia), also called West Malaysia (Malaysia Barat), which is on the
      Malay Peninsula, and East Malaysia (Malaysia Timur), which is on the
      island of Borneo. The Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, lies in the western
      part of the peninsula, about 25 miles (40 km) from the coast; the
      administrative centre, Putrajaya, is located about 16 miles (25 km) south
      of the capital. Malaysia Malaysia Malaysia, a member of the Commonwealth,
      represents the political marriage of territories that were formerly under
      British rule. When it was established on September 16, 1963, Malaysia
      comprised the territories of Malaya (now Peninsular Malaysia), the island
      of Singapore, and the colonies of Sarawak and Sabah in northern Borneo. In
      August 1965 Singapore seceded from the federation and became an
      independent republic. Land Malaysia Malaysia Peninsular Malaysia occupies
      most of the southern segment of the Malay Peninsula. To the north it is
      bordered by Thailand, with which it shares a land boundary of some 300
      miles (480 km). To the south, at the tip of the peninsula, is the island
      republic of Singapore, with which Malaysia is connected by a causeway and
      also by a separate bridge. To the southwest, across the Strait of Malacca,
      is the island of Sumatra in Indonesia. East Malaysia consists of the
      country’s two largest states, Sarawak and Sabah, and is separated from
      Peninsular Malaysia by some 400 miles (640 km) of the South China Sea.
      These two states occupy roughly the northern fourth of the large island of
      Borneo and share a land boundary with the Indonesian portion (Kalimantan)
      of the island to the south. Surrounded by Sarawak is a small coastal
      enclave containing the sultanate of Brunei. Of the country’s total area,
      which includes about 265 square miles (690 square km) of inland water,
      Peninsular Malaysia constitutes about 40 percent and East Malaysia about
      60 percent. Relief The long, narrow, and rugged Malay Peninsula extends to
      the south and southwest from Myanmar and Thailand. The Malaysian portion
      of it is about 500 miles (800 km) long and—at its broadest east-west
      axis—about 200 miles (320 km) wide. About half of Peninsular Malaysia is
      covered by granite and other igneous rocks, one-third is covered by
      stratified rocks older than the granite, and the remainder is covered by
      alluvium. At least half the land area lies more than 500 feet (150 metres)
      above sea level. Singapore, city-state located at the southern tip of the
      Malay Peninsula, about 85 miles (137 kilometres) north of the Equator. It

      is more than half a mile long. The southern limits of the state run
      through Singapore Strait, where outliers of the Riau-Lingga
      Archipelago—which forms a part of Indonesia—extend to within 10 miles of
      the main island. Singapore Singapore Take a tour of Singapore, a city with
